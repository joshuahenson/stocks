A sample React app using Websockets to communicate with the server and share data among all clients given the following user stories.

- User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
- User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- User Story: I can remove stocks.
- User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.
